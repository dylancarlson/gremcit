                             3g--- General ---0
 
    While messages are being dispayed,  you can gstop0 output by pressing 
g"S"0, gpause0 it by pressing g"P"0 (any key to continue), skip to the 
next message by typing "N", skip to the next paragraph by pressing "J", and 
reverse the message direction by typing "R". The g"P>ause J>ump N>ext 
S>top"0 header is a reminder that those work.  The "P", "N", "J", "S", and 
"~" keys work any time GremCit is sending you information.
 
                         3g--- Reading Messages ---0
 
  3b.RE0    -- Read all exclusive messages.
  3b.RF0    -- Read all messages in forward order.
  3b.RL0    -- Read all limited access messages.
    3bN0    -- Read new messages.
  3b.RO0    -- Read old messages.
  3b.RP0    -- Read all public messages.
  3b.RR0    -- Read all messages in reverse order.
  3b.RF*0   -- Read ALL messages by text search forward
  3b.RR*0   -- Read ALL messages by text search reverse
  3b.RN*0   -- Read NEW messages by text search 
 
    These commands read messages in the current room.  The commands 'F', 'N', 'R' and 'O' can by typed at the room prompt.  They can also be combined using .R options, for example:  ".RNR" (Read New Reverse) reads new messages in a reverse order.
 
                        3g--- Entering Messages ---0
 
  3bE0    -- Enter message.
  3b.ELM0 -- Enter Limited Access Message.
  3bM0    -- Enter Mail (Exclusive message).
  3b.EO0  -- Enter Old message.
 
    The Enter Message command is used to create messages.  The Enter Limited 
Access Message command also creates a message, but limits it to a particular 
group (you are prompted for a groupname, partial names are acceptable, and you 
must be a member of the group to create a message in it).  The Enter Mail 
creates a private message.  Private messages can only be seen by the sender 
and recipient.  Enter Old message will recover any message you aborted, if you 
aborted the message the last time you entered a message during the current 
session.
 
    Message entry is very simple.  You just type text (no limit on line 
length, maximum message size is 8196 characters.  To end your message, press 
the carriage return key twice.  This will place you in message edit mode.  
There are several commands.  The most important are:
 
  Replace String  Find & Replace  Save Buffer  Abort Message  and Continue.
 
These do the obvious things.  A "?" will get you a full list of commands.
 
    You can also upload your message using ASCII protocol as well.  Just start 
the message with the (E)nter Public or (M)ail command then start your ascii 
send.  Make sure you do NOT strip CR's or LF's during the transfer. (most 
programs let you configure this).  If you wish to upload the message using 
Xmodem/CRC or Zmodem just hit return until the message entry menu prompt is 
seen and hit 'X' for X modem/CRC or Z for Zmodem then select upload from your 
terminal like you would for uploading any program.  When the upload is 
complete you will be returned to the message menu - just hit 'P' to list the 
message to the screen to make sure it was sent right - then hit 's' to save 
it.
 
                            3g--- Formatting ---0
 
    Messages are formatted to the callers screen width.  As much text as
possible will be collected on one line to send to the caller.  To defeat this,
start a line with a space.  This is also useful for delineating paragraphs in
your text.  Whenever you start a line with a space, that line will always
start a new line, no matter where in the previous line the system
is.  Experiment in message entry using the Print command to see how this works.
