GremCit/064 Soundblaster Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Sound capabilities are enabled in Citadel by loading an External
        Sound Driver (.ESD) driver. This is specified in the
        HARDWARE.CIT file. To add the Soundblaster driver, include the
        following line:

                #SNDDRIVER SB

        See the DRIVERS.DOC file included in the general Citadel
        documentation for more information on using the HARDWARE.CIT
        file.

        In addition, Creative Lab's SBSIM driver must be loaded to use
        the Soundblaster support provided through the SB.ESD driver.

        As sound support is not integral to a BBS, there are no hooks in
        Citadel specific to using the Soundblaster. The only support for
        sound is through Citadel's script language. (Enough information
        is given in this document to implement sound support in Citadel,
        but if you want to know more about the script language, see
        SCRIPT.DOC which is part of the main Citadel documentation.)

        By linking script files to play certain sounds with system
        events with the #EVENT keyword in EXTERNAL.CIT, you can have a
        fair amount of control over sounds on console. The #EVENT
        keyword tells Citadel to run an application every time a
        specific system event occurs. (Enough information is given in
        this document to implement sound support in Citadel, but if you
        want to know more about the #EVENT keyword and EXTERNAL.CIT in
        general, see EXTERNAL.DOC which is part of the main Citadel
        documentation.)
