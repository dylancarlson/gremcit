                                2HELP AIDE0
 
   The Citadel system contains a large collection of features, many of which are quite complex.  The following describes how aide commands act upon messages, rooms, groups, and hallways.  In addition a few miscellaneous commands are described.
 
 
                            2--- Messages ---0
 
 3Marking:0
     Messages can be marked by typing M while the message is printed out. The 
     message will be printed again, and you will be asked to confirm your 
     choice.
 
 3Problem users:0
     Messages from problem users are only visible to aides.  Such messages 
     have the message "[problem user]" prominently in the header. Aides will 
     be prompted "Release? (Y/N)[N]:" after each Problem user message.  If a 
     message is released, all users will be able to see it.  A released 
     message will display "[viewable problem user]" in the header, and can be 
     un-released by marking the message.
 
 3Moderation:0
     Messages posted in moderated rooms will not be viewable to regular users 
     until someone with Aide access releases them.  The message will display 
     "[moderated]" in the header, and the aide will be prompted "Release 
     (Y/N)[N]:" after the message header.  When a message is released, all 
     users can see it. A released message can be un-released by marking it.
 
 3Networked messages:0
     Messages received from the network can be manipulated as can any other 
     message.  Any message posted in a networked room but any user with 
     Network access will be sent over the network.  If a user without network 
     status posts in a networked room, the message will be tagged and GremCit 
     will pause and ask "Release? (Y/N)[Y]:".  If the message is released, it 
     will be sent out on the network, if not it will only be visible on the 
     local system.
 
 3Deleting:0
     To kill messages, type "3k0" while the message is printing out, the 
     message will be printed again, and you will be asked to confirm your 
     choice. Deleted messages are noted in the Aide room, so they can be 
     retrieved if they need to be put back.
 
 "3.AI0"  -- Aide Insert-Message.
     This command inserts the most recently marked or deleted message in the 
     current room.  The message is the same message as the old one.  It has 
     the name of the room it came from added to the header.
 
 
                              2--- Rooms ---0
 
     Rooms can be created by any user (subject to sysop policy).  The sysop 
can optionally choose to restrict room creation only to Aides.

     (8)  Make changes permanent and exit.                 [3S0ave Changes]
