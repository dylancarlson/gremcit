                           2Time/Date Stamp Format0
 
    Time/date stamps may be tailored by each user to their individual
tastes. This is done at the main config menu (3.EC0) with the '3#0'
command.  The format consists of plain text, with special format codes to
represent various attributes of the time/date being processed.  The
following are the format codes which can be used:

    Code        Meaning
    %a          Abbreviated weekday name (Sun, Mon, ...).
    %A          Full weekday name (Sunday, Monday, ...).
    %b          Abbreviated month name (Jan, Feb, ...).
