  3b.EX0  -- Enter eXclude-Room
  3bX0    -- eXclude Room

messages search.  You can still see the room in the Known rooms list, and
.Goto it explicitly.  To re-include a room, you must apply this command again
in the same room.

  3b.RC0  -- Read Configuration
  3b.RS0  -- Read Status

    Read Configuration gives userlog specific information, such as terminal
configurations, forwarding address, groups memberships, and default
hallways.  Read Status gives system-wide global information, like the highest
current message number, average message length, how long the system has been
running, and how long the current user has been logged in.

prints out the call number along with the user's name.
