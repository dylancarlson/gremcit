                ***  Net 1_69 Info ***


  Net 1_69 is net 1_6 with the following mods.

  1. Requesting messages with net ID's.
  -------------------------------------
  1a.  When creating roomrec.tmp.  It retrieves rooms to be requested 
from from rooms.cit NET ID field.  It requests every room net ID of rooms
that are shared and that the other node has group access to.
When parsing roomreq it matches requested rooms with netID's instead of
room names.

  1b. When it gets the messages back it scans rooms.cit instead of nodes
cit for rooms to put messages in. to match #'s for incorporation.

  2. How to handle the room field of net messages and moved messages.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
 2a. When netting out in net 6_9. It compares the room field of the message
to the room name. and if they match then write the NET.ID to the room
field of the message. If they don't match then leaave the room field
of the message alone.

  2b. When netting in it compares the room field of the message against
the net.id. if they don't match, message has been moved, leave the
room field of the message unaltered.  If they match, write the room name
into that field.


                ***  Forwarding to Node Info ***


     92Mar19 09:53:26 From [Wow,] The Gremlin [actually posted.]
   
   E-mail forwarding to node trash. (first draft). As implemented in Gremcit  
.51 for anyone who cares. 
  
  label forward_node;  added to log buffer in ctdl.h. is the node name for 
e-mail to be forwarded. 
  
  (conversion program provided (a first)) 
  
 Rules for Forwarded net e-mail as implemented so far. 
  
  Recipient = person in the T field. 
  Forwardee = person in the F field. 
   
   
 1. If a message is forwarded to a node.  RECIPIENT on local system sees 
message and may respond.   
  
 2. FORWARDEE  on net e-mail does not see message on local system. 
  
 3. On recieving node RECIPIENT does not see message, only FORWARDEE sees it. 
  
 4, When netting in forwarded net E-mail check for existance of FORWARDEE 
instead of RECIPIENT.  
  
  
    the mbfwdhash variable in the message table serves a very limited  
function.  Allows RECIPIENT on local system to see forwarded net e-mail. and 
allows RECIPIENT to see regular non-netted forwarded e-mail, again local use 
only.  
  
  Since mtfwdhash is a local thing only I am thinking I can use the mtomesg 
(origin id) field for it and go down to 13 bytes per message.
