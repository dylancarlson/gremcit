    GremCit has the ability to send messages posted on one system to other
systems, and to recive messages from other systems.  To take advantage of the
networking is fairly simple to use.
 
   NODE or NODENAME refers to the name of another BBS.
   REGION gennerally tells where that BBS is.
 
                    3g--- Reading networked messages ---0

    To read a message that has come in from another GremCit is just like
reading a normal message, and all the usual read commands work.  You can tell
a message that has come over the network by its message header.
 
                    3g--- Sending networked messages ---0

    To send a message over the network, simply post it in a 'netwrked/shared'
room, with the normal Enter commands.  Any room that has messages from another
system in it is a 'networked/shared' room.  GremCit will pick it up and send
it to other GremCits automatically.  To send networked E-Mail, is a little bit
different.  You must use the normal .EE (enter exclusive) command, but for the
username, enter the USER @ NODE like:
 
            Fred Smith @ Big City BBS
 
    The network has no was of knowing if there is a 'Fred Smith' at 'Big City
BBS' so you must have the user name EXACTLY right.
