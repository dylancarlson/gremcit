   Welcome to GremCit!  If you don't understand GremCit commands, you can list
them at any prompt for a menu or a .h? for an expanded list of help files.  If
you wish any further access on this system you MUST leave a message
introducing yourself in the introductions room or in e-mail to the sysop. 
It is highly recommended, if you have an ANSI terminal setting, to use
it.  It will make reading the messages a bit easier.
