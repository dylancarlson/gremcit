The included document, CTDLDOS.DOC, is a text version of a Microsoft
Word file. The formatting has many problems currently, because this
is just a draft version, and we did not spend time fixing the
formatting, which will need to be redone soon anyway.

However, all of the information is included. If you have a way to
read Microsoft Word (version 5.5 for DOS) files, you might want to
original document, as this has a better format, and prints out
nicely. If you want the file, make a request and we will send it to
you.

Also, remember that this is just a draft document: there are holes in
the documentation still, so you will still need to experiment or ask
questions. Also, the document has not been fully proofread, so there
may be inaccuracies in it ranging from misspellings to wholly
inaccurate information.
