        New script functions ICHAR, ICHARNE, DUMPF, DUMPFC, PAUSE, and
        WRITEAPL:

            ICHAR     Takes no parameters, and returns the key the
                      user pressed as a string value. The user's input
                      is echoed to the screen.

            ICHARNE   Takes no parameters, and returns the key the
                      user pressed as a string value. The user's input
                      is not echoed to the screen.

            DUMPF     Takes two parameters: a file name as a string
                      value and a boolean value specifying whether to
                      format the file or not. The file is displayed to
                      the modem user and the console user.

            DUMPFC    Takes two parameters: a file name as a string
                      value and a boolean value specifying whether to
                      format the file or not. The file is displayed to
                      the console user only.

            PAUSE     Takes one parameter: the number of hundreths of
                      a second to pause. Citadel waits at least the
                      specified length of time, but may wait for up to
                      10/182 of a second longer, because that is only
                      how percice MS-DOS is in reporting the time to
                      Citadel.

            WRITEAPL  Takes two parameters: the first is an integer,
                      refering the INPUT.APL field to write; the
                      second is a string, telling what to write for
                      that value. Refer to the following table for
                      valid fields:

                          Code    Value

                      If you wish to use MESSAGE.APL, you must write
                      it out with the file write functions. Remember
                      to put it in the application directory.
