 L         -- Login.
 .L in;pw  -- Single-Line login.
 
 The Login command logs you onto GremCit, and lets you use the system
more effectively than you could otherwise.  The single-line variant of
this command is useful for users who wish to use an auto-login facility
of their terminal program.  If you are a new user, GremCit will ask you
if you want to be added to the userlog.  Usually, it is a good idea to say
yes.
