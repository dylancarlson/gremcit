    Download functions are available in special rooms called directory rooms.  Directory rooms have a "]" after the roomname, rather than the normal ">" character.  The following commands are used to list files, to download them, or to upload files:
 
                          3g--- Listing files ---0
 
 3b.RD0  -- Read Directory
 3b.RVD0 -- Read Verbose Directory (gives file size and dnload times)
 3b.RI0  -- Read Infofile (lists file comments)
 3b.RVI0 -- Read Verbose Infofile (lists long file info and comments)
 3b.RZ0  -- Read ZIP File
 
    The Read Directory commands list the available files in the current room.  This commands waits for an optional filename (possibly wildcarded, per UNIX filename conventions) and will restrict its output to those files selected.  The default is to list all of the files.  The info files are the same, but they include a comment on the file if one was entered during the upload.  The read archive command allows you to view the contents of a archive, .arc .zip and .lzh
 
                        3g--- Downloading files ---0
                        (Receiving files from GremCit)
 
 3b.RT0  -- Read Textfile
 3bD0    -- Download 
 
    These commands download files.  Read Textfile will request a filename, file will be printed (as is) to you.  The Download command will let you choose a protocol.  Note that with batch protocols you can specify multiple file names to download. You can also use UNIX wild cards (see the wild cards section below).
 
                         3g--- Uploading files ---0
                          (Sending files to GremCit)
 
 3b.ET0  -- Enter Textfile
 3bU0    -- Upload 
 
    After supplying the filename, you will be asked to supply a brief comment describing the file. You have about 60 characters.  Using the Limited-access flag will make it a hidden file.  Batch protocols will not prompt you for a file name, but will ask for comments after the transfer for each of the files. (Note:  You terminate a file in Enter Textfile with control-Z).
 
                            3g--- Wildcards ---0
 
    GremCit supports wild cards for file names.  Wildcards work like this:
 
    * replaces any amount of characters
    ? replaces any one character
    [a-z] replaces a range of characters.
