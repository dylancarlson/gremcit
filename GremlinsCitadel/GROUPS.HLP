    Groups are sets of users.  Messages, Rooms, and Hallways can be limited to
a selected group, and users may belong to more than one group.  Group only
rooms have a ":" after the room name instead of the normal ">" character.

  3b.EG0   -- Enter Group only message
  3b.ELR0  -- Enter Limited-access room
 
    After these, you will be prompted for a group name.  You can limit a
message or room to any group which you are a member of.  To find out which
groups you belong to, use the /RC command.
