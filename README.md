The Citadel Archive - Citadel (by Gremlin)
------------------------------------------

* Software: Citadel (by Gremlin; aka GremCit)
* Author: Matthew Pfleger (aka The Gremlin)
* Supported: Mid-1980s
* Platform: MS-DOS
* Language: Microsoft C
* Derived from: [Citadel-86](https://github.com/dylancarlson/citadel-86)
* Ancestor of: [Dragon's Citadel](https://github.com/dylancarlson/citadel-86)
* See Also: [Citadel+](https://github.com/dylancarlson/citplus), StoneHenge

Starting with the Citadel-86 code, Matt duplicated all of Stonehenge's
features, plus he also added many of his own. This code served as the
root for almost all subsequent Citadel development in the Seattle area.

He stopped work on it after 1.30 (which was never used), only to return
several years later, starting with Dragon's Citadel code. This resulted
in Gremlin's Citadel and Citadel+.
